**Grand Entrance:**  The first impression is so important, and we've put the work into making it magical.  From the way she walks, talks, dances, and waves, the Wayfinder Princess will enchant your guests from the moment she arrives!

**Storybook's Signature Storytelling:**  The Wayfinder Princess and her Lady-in-Waiting will captivate your audience with our signature ten minute interactive performance, complete with background music and props. 

**Princess Song:**  To the delight of your party guests, the Wayfinder Princess will sing one of her favorite songs.  All of our performers are beautiful singers who sound like just the character your little one loves!

**Coronation Ceremony:**  The Wayfinder Princess will present the birthday child with a custom made, personalized princess scroll and a beautiful keepsake crystal rhinestone tiara.

**Princess Promise:**  The Wayfinder Princess will talk about what it means to be a princess and lead your party guests in the Princess Promise-- a royal oath pledging to always act with love and grace.  Have your camera ready-- with our giant scroll prop, this is a moment you won't want to miss! 

**Hula Dance Lesson:**  The Wayfinder will teach your party guests how to do a fun hula dance.

**Themed Face Painting:**  The Lady-in-Waiting will do simple themed face painting for the children at the event.  Guests can choose from designs such as flowers, waves, and more!  (*dependent on number of guests at event and amount of time booked)
