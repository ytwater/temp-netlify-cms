# Sleeping Beauty

To book Sleeping Beauty for your royal celebration, reserve online or call us at the castle at (858) 848-0008.

<div class="boxed">

**Why book with Storybook?**  Our devotion to character integrity paired with our beautifully talented cast ensure you're getting theme-park quality entertainment.  In addition to the character, your reservation includes a Lady-in-Waiting assistant to allow the princess more time to create magical memories with the party guests.  You'll believe they stepped right out of the storybook!

## Character Entertainment Includes:

**Grand Entrance:** From the way she walks, talks, twirls, and waves, Sleeping Beauty will enchant your guests the moment she arrives!

**Storybook's Signature Storytelling:**  Sleeping Beauty and her Lady-in-Waiting will captivate your audience with our signature ten minute interactive performance, complete with background music and props. 

**Princess Song:**  To the delight of your party guests, Sleeping Beauty will sing one of her favorite songs.  All of our performers are phenomenal singers -- it's a requirement here!

**Coronation Ceremony:**  Sleeping Beauty will present the birthday child with a custom made, personalized princess scroll and a beautiful keepsake crystal rhinestone tiara.

**Princess Promise:**  Sleeping Beauty will talk about what it means to be a princess and lead your party guests in the Princess Promise-- a royal oath pledging to always act with love and grace.  Have your camera ready-- with our giant scroll prop, this is a moment you won't want to miss! 

**Royal Dance Lesson:**  We'll provide ribbon wands for your party guests to use during Sleeping Beauty's royal dance lesson.

**Themed Face Painting:**  The Lady-in-Waiting will do simple themed face painting for the children at the event.  Guests can choose from designs such as a rose, fairies, princess crowns, and more!  (*dependent on number of guests at event and amount of time booked)

**Photo Opportunities:**  Before her departure, Sleeping Beauty will teach your guests to pose like a princess and you'll have the opportunity for individual and group photos.

**Cake Ceremony:**   We'll lead the "Happy Birthday" song and the Lady-in-Waiting assistant would be delighted to help serve dessert to your royal guests.

**Autographed Photo:**  Sleeping Beauty will present each child with an autographed keepsake photo.
