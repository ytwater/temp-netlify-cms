**Grand Entrance:** The first impression is so important, and we've put the work into making it magical.  From the way she walks, talks, twirls, and waves, the Winter Princess will enchant your guests from the moment she arrives!

**Storybook's Signature Storytelling:**  The Winter Princess and her Lady-in-Waiting will captivate your audience with our signature ten minute interactive performance, complete with background music and props.

**Coronation Ceremony:**  The Winter Princess will present the birthday child with a custom made, personalized princess scroll and a beautiful keepsake crystal rhinestone tiara.

**Princess Promise:**  The Winter Princess will talk about what it means to rule over a kingdom and lead your party guests in the Princess Promise-- a royal oath pledging to always act with love and grace.  Have your camera ready-- with our giant scroll prop, this is a moment you won't want to miss! 

**Royal Dance Lesson:**  We'll provide ribbon wands for your party guests to use during the Winter Princess's royal dance lesson.
